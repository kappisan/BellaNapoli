	<p>This was a new client of mine which opened in September 2016. The Sanctuary is a restaurant in Ipswich which needed menus, marketing equipment and a logo. In the future I intend to make a website for this company.</p><br><br>

<p>We decided to create a gift card to try and drive repeat business. This idea is similar to what most coffee shops use. If you buy 6 times you get a free coffee. However this is an idea closer to the Nando's tactic. After eating 3 times you get half a chicken free and on the 6th you get a whole chicken free. We used this idea but as a whole meal. The business will not lose money because after 6 times they have already made enough money from this customer to afford this. The main tactic is that people do not tend to eat out alone so they will bring more pople with them spreading the loss across the bill. The paper used is 300gsm dark eco card.</p><br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
<p>The menus are printed on the same 300gsm dark eco card a4. This is a popular style among many restaurants right now. The reason this paper worked well with this brand is because the food, the environment and ethos are healthy and environmentally conscious.</p><br><br><br><br>
